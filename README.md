# CNN-Complex-Images
Code with a link to a happy or sad dataset which contains 80 images, 40 happy and 40 sad.

A convolutional neural network is created that trains to 100% accuracy on these images, which cancels training upon hitting training accuracy of >.999

It will work best with 3 convolutional layers.
